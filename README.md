# NLP-Fake-news-detection

Explore how sequential models in Deep Learning can be used to distinguish between reliable and unreliable news stories. The goal of the Fake News Challenge is to explore how artificial intelligence technologies, particularly machine learning and natural language processing, might be leveraged to combat the fake news problem. We believe that these AI technologies hold promise for significantly automating parts of the procedure human fact checkers use today to determine if a story is real or hoax

Skills and Tools: Statistical NLP techniques, Glove, LSTM, Attention Models
